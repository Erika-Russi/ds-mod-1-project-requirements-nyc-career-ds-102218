# Module 1 Projects

Welcome to module 1 projects!  You are assigned to a pair, and will have until Monday evening to work on projects.  On Tuesday, we'll move onto Module 2, and have science fair on Tuesday afternoon.

Projects are designed to review the material we covered in module 1:

* data structures
* object orientation
* SQL
* ORMs
* Flask and Dash
* ETL

Requirements for projects are the following:

* At least 3 models.  The models must include a belongs to has many relationship.
* Use of ORM aggregate methods: AVG, SUM, Count, etc.
* ETL with use of at least one, and ideally two APIs (API or scraping is fine)
* A Dash app that is connected to a Flask/sqlalchemy back end
